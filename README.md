ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project is an Internship Web Application developed as part of my internship program.
It is a Foreign Exchange (FX) System that allows users to exchange currencies through a simple and user-friendly web interface.

The system provides:

ðŸ’± Real-time currency exchange rates

ðŸ‘¤ Secure user authentication (login/register)

ðŸ“Š A responsive and intuitive frontend for seamless user experience

The main purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with web development, improve practical programming skills, and understand how to build and deploy a real-world application.
